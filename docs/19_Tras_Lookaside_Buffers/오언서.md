# 페이징: 더 빠른 변환(TLB)

TLB: Translation-lookaside buffer <br>
- Part of the chip's memory-management unit(MMU) <br>
- A hardware cacher of popular virtual-to-physical address translation. <br>

TLB Basic Algorithms <br>

## Example: Accessing an array
- How a TLB can improve its performance <br>

## Locality
- Temporal Locality
	- An instruction or data item that has been recently accessed will likely be re-accessed soon in the future.
- Spatial Locality
	- If a program accesses memory at address x, it will likely soon access memory near x.
